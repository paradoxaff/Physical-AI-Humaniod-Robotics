# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Physical AI (Embodied Intelligence)
Content must strictly follow the provided course document and connect software intelligence to physical embodiment. All explanations must bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body, focusing on how AI systems operate in the physical world through embodied intelligence.

### Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real)
Engineering-first approach with industry-aligned tooling only (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac). No motivational fluff - practical over theoretical content that enables students to transition from simulated to real-world environments effectively.

### Humanoid Robotics & ROS 2-based Control
Each lesson must be usable independently for RAG-based retrieval and written for Docusaurus (Markdown / MDX only). Content must strictly follow the provided course document and connect software intelligence to physical embodiment.

### Physics-based Simulation
All explanations must connect software intelligence to physical embodiment. Each lesson must be usable independently for RAG-based retrieval and written for Docusaurus (Markdown / MDX only).

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Conversational Robotics
Written for the target audience of AI & Robotics students, engineers entering Physical AI, hackathon participants, and startup-focused builders. Content must be instructor-grade, clear, precise, and technical.

## Additional Requirements

### Content Standards
- Content must strictly follow the provided course document
- Engineering-first, no motivational fluff
- All explanations must connect software intelligence to physical embodiment
- Each lesson must be usable independently for RAG-based retrieval
- Written for Docusaurus (Markdown / MDX only)

### Technology Stack
- Industry-aligned tooling only (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac)
- Written for Docusaurus (Markdown / MDX only)
- Target audience considerations: AI & Robotics students, engineers entering Physical AI, hackathon participants, startup-focused builders

## Development Workflow

### Course Structure
- Primary Goal: Bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body by teaching students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots in simulated and real-world environments
- Foundational Pillars: Physical AI (Embodied Intelligence), Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real), Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2-based robotic control, Physics-based simulation, Vision-Language-Action (VLA), Conversational Robotics
- Tone & Style: Instructor-grade, clear, precise, and technical, practical over theoretical

### Audience Alignment
Content must be tailored for:
- AI & Robotics students
- Engineers entering Physical AI
- Hackathon participants
- Startup-focused builders

## Governance

This constitution governs all specifications, plans, tasks, and implementations for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. All development activities must align with these principles and requirements. Any deviations must be documented and approved through formal amendment procedures.
